# HAB796B9 - Software development


(Almost) everything you need to know concerning coding and system administration.

## Teachers

- Jean-Michel Marin : jean-michel.marin@umontpellier.fr,
- Benjamin Charlier : benjamin.charlier@umontpellier.fr

This course material was improved with the help of some students including:

- Amelie Vernay
- Tanguy Lefort


## Prerequisite

Students are expected to know some rudiments on coding (if, for, while, functions) but not mandatory.

## Course description

This course focuses on discovering good coding practices (the language used being Python, but some element of bash and git will also be useful) for professional coding.
A special focus on data processing and visualization will be at the heart of the course.
We will mostly focus on basic programming concepts, as well as on discovering the Python scientific libraries, including ```numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn```.
Beyond `pandas` ninja skills, we will also introduce modern practices for coders : (unitary) tests, version control, documentation generation, etc.
